too lazy to make it neat or something because this is just for a history project

to use, populate a results.json file in the same directory as the git page<br>
here's a starter template.

```json
{
  "initialized": false,
  "init_money": 10000,
  "stock_name": "SYMBOL",
  "timeline": {}
}
```

and run stock.py to update the tracker<br>
to read your results, run result_reader.py<br>

to run any script, ensure you have python installed (https://www.python.org/) and type python script_name
